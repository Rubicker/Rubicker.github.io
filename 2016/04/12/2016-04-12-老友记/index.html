<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh God… well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet ‘n Low?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that’s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y’know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but… Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering ‘Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?’. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn’t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you’re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Who wasn’t invited to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>[Scene: Monica’s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Now I’m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she’s really not happy about it. </p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (on phone) Daddy, I just… I can’t marry him! I’m sorry. I just don’t love him. Well, it matters to me! </p>
<p>(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. </p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: I say push her down the stairs. </p>
<p><strong>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey</strong>:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!</p>
<p>(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: C’mon Daddy, listen to me! It’s like, it’s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, ‘You’re a shoe! You’re a shoe, you’re a shoe, you’re a shoe!’. And today I just stopped and I said, ‘What if I don’t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a purse, y’know? Or a hat! No, I’m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I’m saying I am a ha- It’s a metaphor, Daddy!</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Ross</strong>: You can see where he’d have trouble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see where he’d have trouble:Apparently, we can tell that Rach’s dad made fun of Rach’s metaphor by saying “buy her a hat”, and pretended that he didn’t know what Rach was talking about. But what’s even worse is that Rach didn’t get her dad’s little trick either.So she yelled at the phone that “It’s a metaphor,Daddy!”. Once she realized how rude and unladily(adj.不淑女的) she was just now, her eyes met with Ross’s, which made Ross rather embarrassing. So he ended up saying that “You can see where he’d have trouble.” That means “you can see misunderstanding your metaphor is where he’d have trouble to communicate with you smoothly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Look Daddy, it’s my life. Well maybe I’ll just stay here with Monica. </p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, I guess we’ve established who’s staying here with Monica…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I guess we’ve established who’s staying here with Monica：Monica has no idea why Rachel said that. But she can’t just abandon Rach at this critical time, so when her friends turned to her for a verification, she can’t think of nothing to say except that: “Well, it seems to Rachel that I have already agreed on the whole moving in thing( that is established an agreement on her moving in), although I have nothing to do with it!!(Don’t look at me in this weird way, guys!)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Time Lapse, Rachel is breathing into a paper bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Just breathe, breathe.. that’s it. Just try to think of nice calm things… </p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens… La la la la…something and noodles with string.  These are a few…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>raindrop n.雨滴<br>kitten n.小猫<br>bluebell n.野风信子<br>sleighbell n.雪橇<br>mitten n.棒球手套<br>“My Favorite Things” is a song from the musical The Sound of Music. The music for “My Favorite Things” was composed by Richard Rodgers, and the lyrics were written by Oscar Hammerstein II. In the musical, the lyrics to the song are a litany(n.冗长而枯燥的事) of things that Maria loves, such as “raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.” These are the things she selects to fill her mind with when times get bad and sad.The wintertime imagery(n.比喻) of some of the lyrics has made “My Favorite Things” a popular song during the Christmas season, and it often appears on holiday-themed albums and compilations, although in the show and movie it is sung during a summer thunderstorm.</p>

It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield, and was therefore not capable of space operations; its purpose was to perform test flights in the atmosphere.Originally, Enterprise had been intended to be refitted(v.改装) for orbital flight, which would have made it the second space shuttle[n.(往返于地球和太空站之间运载人和物资的)航天飞机] to fly after Columbia. However, during the construction of Columbia, details of the final design changed, particularly with regard to the weight of the fuselage(n.机身) and wings. Refitting Enterprise for flight would have involved dismantling(v.拆除) the orbiter(n.人造卫星) and returning the sections to subcontractors(n. 分包者) across the country. As this was an expensive proposition, it was determined to be less costly to build Challenger around a body frame (“STA-099”) that had been created as a test article. Similarly, Enterprise was considered for refit to replace Challenger after the latter was destroyed, but Endeavour was built from structural spares instead. </p>
